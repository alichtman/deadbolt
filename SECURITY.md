## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability, please report it by emailing `aaronlichtman@gmail.com`. I will respond as soon as possible. I can open a [security advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/about-repository-security-advisories#about-repository-security-advisories) and work with you to fix the issue before disclosing it to the public.
